# freebsd-libcc-release

This repository contains the FreeBSD build scripts, patches and releases for [electron/libchromiumcontent](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent).

Since FreeBSD is currently not officially supported in their [Release Cycle](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent#releases), we manually build libcc as a prerequisite for the future [FreeBSD port of Electron (WIP)](https://github.com/yzgyyang/freebsd-ports-electron).

## Releases

These releases are for FreeBSD 11.1+ only.

[v59.0.3071.115](https://github.com/yzgyyang/freebsd-libcc-release/releases/tag/v59.0.3071.115)

## Credits

Thanks @prash-wghats for his great work and support!
